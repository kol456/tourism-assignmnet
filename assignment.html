  <p style="font-size:larger;text-align:left;color: whitesmoke;">The Taj Mahal is the most perfect example of Mughal architecture, halfway between Persian, Islamic and Indian influences.
       It is an octagonal white marble building with <br> 4 main sides and 4 intermediate  sides.
        The whole is perfectly symmetrical. The main faces all have an iwan, these giant ogive-shaped porches. 
        At the top is an impressive <br> bulb-shaped dome. <br> Despite its impressive proportions it seems to  be very light, it is due to both the fineness of the decorations and the good proportion of the iwans who dig the facades in a<br> harmonious whole. 
      This is typically a Persian style, and is found in several buildings in Uzbekistan, for example.</p> <br>

          <p> Kashmir, region of the northwestern Indian subcontinent. It is bounded by the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang to the northeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the <br>east (both parts of China), by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south, by Pakistan to the west, and by Afghanistan to the northwest. The region, with a total<br> area of some 85,800 square miles (222,200 square km), has been the subject of dispute between India and Pakistan since the partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947. The <br>northern and western portions are administered by Pakistan and comprise three areas: Azad Kashmir, Gilgit, and Baltistan, the last two being part of a territory called the Northern <br>Areas. Administered by India are the southern and southeastern portions, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The Indian- and Pakistani-administered portions are divided by a “line <br>of control” agreed to in 1972, although neither country recognizes it as an international boundary. In addition, China became active in the eastern area of Kashmir in the 1950s and has controlled the northeastern part of Ladakh (the easternmost portion of the region) since 1962.</p>

            <p>Ladakh covers about 45,000 square miles (117,000 square km) and contains the Ladakh Range, which is a southeastern extension of the Karakoram Range, and the upper Indus <br>River valley. Ladakh is one of the highest regions of the world. Its natural features consist mainly of high plains and deep valleys. The high plain predominates in the east, diminishing <br>gradually toward the west. In southeastern Ladakh lies Rupshu, an area of large, brackish lakes with a uniform elevation of about 13,500 feet (4,100 metres). To the northwest of <br>Rupshu lies the Zaskar Range, an inaccessible region where the people and the cattle remain indoors for much of the year because of the cold. Zaskar is drained by the Zaskar River, <br>which,flowing northward, joins the Indus River below Leh. In the heart of Ladakh, farther to the north, cultivation by means of manuring and irrigation is practiced by farmers living in <br>valley villages at elevations between about 9,000 and 15,000 feet (2,750 and 4,550 metres). Shepherds tend flocks in the upland valleys that are too high for cultivation. Leh, the most accessible town of Ladakh, is an important trade centre located 160 miles (260 km) east of Srinagar.</p>

            <p>Goa -- Silver sands, sparkling blue waters, the sky mirroring the sea below, white churches resting against green paddy fields and coconut trees lining the coastal streets. Goa - a place you can fall in love with at first glance. There's much more to Goa than sun, sand and sea. The allure of Goa is that it remains quite distinct from the rest of India and is small enough to be grasped and explored in a way that other Indian states are not. Ruled by the Portuguese till 1961, Goa still retains its indo-portuguese character -- very visible amongst its architecture as well as its people. Goa's tourism byline of "Goa - 365 days on Holiday" is absolutely true.

              Tourists inevitably come to Goa only for its sandy beaches, but experienced travellers say that the beaches are only a part of the attraction of Goa. Goa has 500 year old churches, forts and temples, trekking routes, waterfalls, wildlife sanctuaries and even spice plantations that are worth visiting. </p>

            <p>Jaisalmer - The name Jaisalmer evokes a vivid picture of sheer magic and brilliance of the desert. Local colour and warmth prevail over the inhospitable and forbidding terrain, imbuing <br>the medieval town with a special magic.

              One of the main attractions is the imposing 12th century Jaisalmer fort. The beautiful havelis which were built by wealthy merchants of Jaisalmer are yet another interesting aspect of the desert city. And, of course, the romantic sand dunes, the best way of exploring them and the desert around being by way of a camel safari.<br>
            
              The Golden City of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan is simply unmatched. It was the part of the famous Silk Route during the days of yore. The splendid Jaisalmer Fort stands proudly on its land <br>and narrates the stories of the valor and chivalry of the Rajput rulers. Jaisalmer still retains its medieval charm, which is evident in its colorful narrow streets, splendid forts and palaces <br>of Rajasthan, opulent havelis and bazaars.
